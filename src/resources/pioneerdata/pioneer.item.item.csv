\b 1.\b0  Using the Principles of Geometric Dilution, mix Liothyronine and Microcrystalline Cellulose (PH-105) together with trituration in a mortar and pestle. \par
\par
\b 2.\b0  Triturations should have powders where the particle size is the same throughout.  Once powders are thoroughly mixed, sieve through an 80 mesh sieve to ensure even particle size.     Do not force large particles through the sieve as this destroys the integrity of the sieve.  Instead, any particles remaining in the sieve should be triturated in mortar and pestle to reduce particle size, and ALL powders should be sieved again.\par
\par
\par
\b Note: Each Gm of trituration will provide 1 Milligram of Liothyronine Sodium (T3) .\b0\par
\par
\par
\b Note: Protect from light.\b0\par

WARNING! SAFETY WHEN COMPOUNDING: Precautions should be taken when compounding hormone and other steroids, as they can be absorbed through skin, mucous membranes and lungs.  Wear appropriate lab apparel, eye protection and respirator.  Use an appropriate filter system to reduce the amount of airborne chemical particles in your lab.  Monitor to ensure there is no direct exposure to the compounder.  \par

\par
\par
\par
\b Note \b0 :Beyond Use Dates of preparations are conservative estimates by the formulator using reference books, peer reviewed literature, intended duration of therapy, formulation from commercially available products, organoleptic stability observations and current USP guidelines.  Compounders may have stability tests performed by a reputable laboratory if they wish to extend the Beyond Use Date.\par

\b 1.\b0  Using the Principles of Geometric Dilution, mix Anastrozole, Food Color Powder and Microcrystalline Cellulose (PH-105) together with trituration in a mortar and pestle. \par
\par
\b 2.\b0  Triturations should have powders where the particle size is the same throughout.  Once powders are thoroughly mixed, sieve through an 80 mesh sieve (PCCA #35-3125) to ensure even particle size.     Do not force large particles through the sieve as this destroys the integrity of the sieve.  Instead, any particles remaining in the sieve should be triturated in mortar and pestle to reduce particle size, and ALL powders should be sieved again.\par
\par
\par
\b Note: Each Gm of trituration will provide 20 milligrams of Anastrozole.\b0\par
\par
\par
\b Note: Protect from light.\b0\par

WARNING! SAFETY WHEN COMPOUNDING: Precautions should be taken when compounding hormone and other steroids, as they can be absorbed through skin, mucous membranes and lungs.  Wear appropriate lab apparel, eye protection and respirator.  Use an appropriate filter system to reduce the amount of airborne chemical particles in your lab.  Monitor to ensure there is no direct exposure to the compounder.  \par

\b Note \b0 :Beyond Use Dates of preparations are conservative estimates by the formulator using reference books, peer reviewed literature, intended duration of therapy, formulation from commercially available products, organoleptic stability observations and current USP guidelines.  Compounders may have stability tests performed by a reputable laboratory if they wish to extend the Beyond Use Date.\par
